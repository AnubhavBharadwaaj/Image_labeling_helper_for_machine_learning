# Image_labeling_helper_for_machine_learning
It is the python code for a GUI which allows us to label multiple images using clicks instead of typing them separately. All we have to do is to provide the directory in which our images are located and the class labels which we want to assign to these images. The labels provided must be "+" delimited. At the end we can download a .csv file which will be containing the full paths of these images alongside the numerical and alphabetical labels we provided them. I made this for people who want to quickly label a batch of say 2000 images to be trained on a SVM or any other model with ease as clicks are always faster.
